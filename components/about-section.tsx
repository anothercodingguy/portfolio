      <p>
        Hello! I'm Suyash, a passionate software developer with a love for creating elegant solutions to complex
        problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        I specialize in full-stack web development, with expertise in modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries. When
        I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or enjoying
        the outdoors.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and am constantly learning to improve my craft. My goal is to
        build applications that not only solve problems but also provide delightful user experiences.
      </p>
