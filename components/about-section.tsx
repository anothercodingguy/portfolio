      <p>
        Hello! I&apos;m Suyash, a passionate software developer with a love for creating elegant solutions to complex
        problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        I specialize in full-stack web development, with expertise in modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries. When
        I&apos;m not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or enjoying
        the outdoors.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and am constantly learning to improve my craft. My goal is to
        build applications that solve problems.
      </p>
